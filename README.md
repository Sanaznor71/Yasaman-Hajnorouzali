# 👋 Hi, I'm Yasaman Hajnorouzali

**Ph.D. Researcher @ University of Oklahoma | Autonomous Vehicle Software Engineer**

I specialize in **AI-driven robotics** and **End-to-End learned driving stacks**. My work focuses on bridging the "sim-to-real" gap by taking models from **CARLA** simulations and deploying them on real-world platforms like the **Nissan Leaf** via **openpilot**.

- 🏎️ **Current Focus:** Curvature-based path planning at complex intersections.
- 🛠️ **Tech Stack:** PyTorch, tinygrad, ONNX, ROS2, C++, and CUDA.
- 📝 **Latest Research:** ["Curvature-Based End-to-End Autonomous Vehicle Path Planning at Intersections" (SAE 2026)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1tNpm2wAAAAJ).
